Assignment #1 : Parking Lot Simulation
README

1. Files included in the project

	a. AssignmetMain.java 
		Program starts from here.
	b. Car.java
		Represents the car and contains the respective attributes.
	c. ParkingSystem.java
		Represents the parking system. Contains the statistical counters.
	d. Event.java
		Contains the interface for the events.
	e. EntryEvent.java
		Represents the entry event when the car enters the entry queue.
	f. ParkEvent.java
		Represents the parked event. Has the list of cars parked which is a priority queue which uses the time 
		comparator to compare the time the car leaves the lot.
	g. ExitEvent.java
		Represents the exit event when the car enters the exit queue.
	h. DepartureEvent.java
		Represents the departure event when the car exits out of the system.
	i. TimeComparator.java
		Used to compare the priority queue items.
	j. Test files.

	
2. Compile.
	
	javac AssignmentMain.java
	
3. Run

	java AssignmentMain
	
4. Design Decisions.
	
	We have decided to use Java and use the object oriented benefits. We have a parking system which 
	has a list of cars that enter the system, number of parking spots, list of cars parked 
	and entry queue and an exit queue.
	
	We used a priority queue for the list of cars parked which will compare the time that the car enters
	the exit queue and sort as per the order. 
	
	The end of simulation happens when the total number of cars that has entered the system becomes 50.
	
5. Deficiencies

	We have yet to figure out the efficient use of the distribution of the parking interval.
	We also have to come up with an input file that has all the user configurable parameters.
